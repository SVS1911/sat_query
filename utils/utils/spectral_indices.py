utils/spectral_indices.py
--------------------------
Land-cover classification from spectral bands — the default backend behind
"remote-sensing-adapted vision-language component" (models/base_vlm.py).

WHY THIS FILE WAS REWRITTEN (real bug fix, not cosmetic)
----------------------------------------------------------
The original version guessed water/vegetation/built-up from RGB color alone
(blueness, darkness, greenness). That's a proxy, and proxies break constantly
on real imagery: dark rooftops, asphalt, and shadow all get read as "water";
bright bare soil or cloud gets read as "built-up". This is almost certainly
what produced the false water-body detections on real Microsoft Planetary
Computer (Sentinel-2) scenes.

The fix: when real NIR/SWIR bands are present (which Sentinel-2 data from
Planetary Computer has), compute the *actual* remote-sensing indices these
classes are defined by:
  - NDVI  = (NIR - Red) / (NIR + Red)                  — vegetation
  - NDWI  = (Green - NIR) / (Green + NIR)   [McFeeters] — open water
  - MNDWI = (Green - SWIR1) / (Green + SWIR1)           — water, more robust
            to built-up confusion than NDWI
  - NDBI  = (SWIR1 - NIR) / (SWIR1 + NIR)                — built-up
These are far more reliable than color guessing, but only work if we know
*which band index is which*. Silently guessing that (the old bug) is worse
than not guessing at all — Planetary Computer stacks commonly ship as
Blue,Green,Red,NIR or Red,Green,Blue,NIR or the full 12/13-band L2A order,
and guessing wrong silently corrupts every downstream answer. So this module
never guesses band roles on its own for 4+ band imagery; callers pass an
explicit `BandRoles` (see BAND_PRESETS below for the common Planetary
Computer layouts, selectable in the UI) and everything downstream is
computed from real indices instead of color.

For plain 3-band RGB (PNG/JPEG, or true-color-only GeoTIFF with no NIR/SWIR),
there is no substitute for real spectral bands, so the RGB proxy remains —
but ImageEvidence.notes always says explicitly whether true indices or a
color proxy were used, so this is auditable per request rather than a silent
guess.
